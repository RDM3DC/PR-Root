# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support the latest release on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- Do not open a public issue with exploit details.
- Instead, open a minimal issue that requests a private contact channel, or contact the maintainers privately if a channel is listed in the repository.

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical and will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.
